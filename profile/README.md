## LLM Microservice

Tools and utilities for building AI/LLM microservices that are safe, secure, and efficient.

Why would you build your GenAI/LLM applications as microservices? In addition to the [general benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices#Benefits) of microservice architectures, building AI applications as 
microservices has important LLM-specific benefits: security, observability, and operational simplicity. Because LLMs are non-deterministic, hallucinate, and can be hijacked and jailbroken, you need to treat
LLMs as potentially adversarial, like you would an external user. We have the infrastructure, patterns, and decades of experience providing safe encapsulation in (micro)service-oriented architectures and we can apply
those to LLMs.

That gives you a simple roadmap to adopting LLMs without taking on a huge risk:

1. Put your data behind an API.
2. You know how to secure, observe, and run APIs.
3. This project gives you the tools to connect APIs to LLMs quickly, efficiently, and securely.
4. Build your LLM applications.
